# Environment Sound Classification

## Background

This project contains a convolutional neural network which classifies 10 different recorded sounds:
* air_conditioner
* car_horn
* children_playing
* dog_bark 
* drilling
* engine_idling
* gun_shot
* jackhammer 
* siren 
* street_music


This project was created in order to reproduce the results obtained from the sensors_paper.pdf (cite properly), the paper itself conatains a few inconsistencies but used to recreate a classifier. The training and testing datasets used by the convolutional neural netowrk can be found (provide link).
