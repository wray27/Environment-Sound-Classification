# Environment Sound Classification

## Background

This project was created in order to reproduce the results obtained from the sensors_paper.pdf (cite properly), the paper itself contains a few inconsistencies but was used to successfully recreate the convolutional neural network. 

The network classifies 10 different recorded sounds:
* air_conditioner
* car_horn
* children_playing
* dog_bark 
* drilling
* engine_idling
* gun_shot
* jackhammer 
* siren 
* street_music

The training and testing datasets used by the network can be found (provide link).
